# Black-Ops-3-Round-100-Ray-Gun-Mod

This Black Ops 3 Mod was made in GSC with help from [ModMe](https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/Game-Support-_-Black-Ops-3.html), and [CabCon](https://cabconmodding.com/#google_vignette). The template for the Mod was provided by Cabcon: [CabCon Template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpI8FPw0IzI).

I created this mod to allow the player to start a zombies game at round 100, and with the ray gun on any of the Black Ops 3 maps. The mod also provides the user with all of the base perks found on the map, aswell as an increased zombie speed, and decreased zombie health. 

This was my first mod when beggining to learn GSC, and I hope to continue my learning and build off of this!
